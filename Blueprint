Title:
	 Forecasting univariate stock indices with parametric models and neural networks: A comparison

Structure:
	0. Introduction	
		- Why am I doing this analysis?
		- Why is it relevant?
		- What are my findings?
		- Structure of the work.
		- 
	1. Explaining the models
		- Classical Statistical Anylsis
			- Exponential Smoothing
			- ARIMA
		- Artificial neural networks
			- Biological Idea
			- The neuron
			- Error backpropagation
				- Vanishing / Exploding Gradient
			- (Multi-Layer) Perceptron
			- RNNs (LSTM)
		- Error metrics
			- MASE
			- RMSE
			- MAE

	2. Data preparations and fitting
		2.1 Data preparations
			- Achieve stationarity (differencing)
			- Check for outliers (plot), log for variance stabilization
			- Test for stationarity (Unit root tests: ADF, KPSS)
			- Test for normality (Jaque Bera,...) 
			- Test for distribution (Anderson-Darling test, ...)
			- Fit to distribution (skew-normal, t, skew-t)		
		2.2 Exponential smoothing
			2.2.1 Simple Exponential Smoothing
			2.2.2 Holt / Winter
		2.3 AR(I)MA
			2.3.1 
		/* 2.4 GARCH */ - Stupid Idea
		2.5 MLP
		2.6 ARIMA-MLP (Khashei and Bijari, 2009)
		2.7 LSTM

	3. Discussion

Think about this:
	Do I need backtesting? -No
	How will I implement bootstrapping? - Don't need that either
